## About Me
I am a computational neuroscientist at the Institute of High Performance Computing (IHPC), Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A\*STAR), Singapore. I work in Dr Ilya Farber's Cognitive and Decision Science group under the Brain-Body Initiative, where we seek to understand the neural correlates of stress so as to pre-empt and reduce workplace burnout and chronic stress. For my PhD, I worked on improving methods for EEG source localization to characterize brain states during anesthesia, sedation and sleep.
