## About Me

I am a computational neuroscientist (IHPC, A*STAR, Singapore) with experience in neuroimaging, cognitive science and clinical data analytics. I collaborate actively with clinicians and university academics, contributing technical expertise in areas such as EEG data analysis, cognitive experiment design and implementation, and scientific coding. 

I’m interested in leveraging my scientific expertise to solve real-world business problems. To that end, I’m currently pursuing a part-time MBA (NUS, Singapore) with dual specializations in Consulting and Healthcare Management. I initiated and led a committee to organize the first-ever NUS MBA Healthcare Case Competition, which attracted 128 participants from 26 schools across 13 countries [[LinkedIn post]](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/gladia-hotan_the-inaugural-nus-mba-healthcare-case-competition-activity-7335156970389209088-kGSn?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAD1jWbMBaDghXMluPTIDn405-skklB8mufI).
